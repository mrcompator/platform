- report an error if the project module is neither Web nor DB

- use email as a username for the platform authentication

- add a well-known API for checking permission (e.g. "POST users/me/permission/check {"permission":value})

- compute the initial application useAuth value based on the presence of the AuthScheme; or
  ignore the value during container creation if the AuthScheme is not present

- DEFERRED: create an admin group 0; admin user belongs to admin group; group="user"

- use "notifyOnClose" handler to report a connection failure due to unloaded db app

- always start registration with "self" provider (to create a temporary key) before "renewing"
  with certbot; alternatively we can simply disallow passing a provider into "register" API

- consider a possibility of multi-certificate "host", e.g. "host.cvs.com.xqiz.it" and
  "xtc-host.cvs.com" both pointing to the same Azure hosted "xtc-host.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com"

- add constraints to the FileStore injected by the hosted apps
    - total persistent size no more than X Gb
    - total number of file nodes no more than X

- add constraints to Timer and Clock injected by the hosted apps
    - No "persistent" alarms for a free app
